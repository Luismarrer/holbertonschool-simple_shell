# C - Simple Shell Final Project

This project is a team effort by three individuals at Holberton Coding School. The main objective is to develop a simple UNIX command interpreter.

## Description of the project

In this projet we did a copy of a simple shell program which is a basic Unix shell that provides a command-line interface for users to execute commands. It reads commands from the standard
input and executes them.

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / "end-of-file"?

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
